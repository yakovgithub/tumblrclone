A counter-notification is the proper method for You to dispute the removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice.  The information that You provides in a counter-notification must be accurate and truthful, and You will be liable for any misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be brought against Us relating to the Content.</p>

<p>To submit a counter-notification, please provide Our Designated Copyright agent the following information:</p>

<p>(a)    A specific description of the material that was removed or disabled pursuant to the Notice.</p>

<p>(b)   A description of where the material was located within the Site or the Content before such material was removed and/or disabled.  Please provide the specific URL if possible.</p>

<p>(c)    A statement reflecting the Recipient's belief that the removal or disabling of the material was done so erroneously.  For convenience, the following format may be used:“I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the referenced material was removed or disabled by the service provider as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”</p>

<p>(d)   The Recipient's physical address, telephone number, and email address.  </p>

<p>Upon receiving Your DMCA-compliant counter-notification, xstumbl will provide the counter-claim to the entity that originally provided the Notice concerning the material in question. xstumbl will allow up to fourteen (14) days for a remedy to come about. In the case of a successful counter-claim, xstumbl, in their sole discretion, may but not limited to re-instate Your Members Account, replace any deleted Media or take no action at all.</p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>10. Prohibited Content</strong></p>

<p>xstumbl is an adult microblogging community that promotes the freedom of adult sexual expression. Use xstumbl to curate, showcase, and display your sexual interests, thoughts, or identity. You may NEVER use xstumbl to promote, encourage or endorse the following:</p>

<p>(a) Harm to or Exploitation of Minors. No content featuring anyone under the age of eighteen (18) years of age may be posted, shared, or discussed anywhere on the site. You will immediately be banned and reported to your local law enforcement agency if you violate this provision.</p>

<p>(b) Drug Use or Promotion of Drug Activity. Do not post or share content of any individual engaged in any use of illegal drugs. These items are illegal and against federal law. Promotion of these materials or activities will result in account suspension and IP blocking.</p>

<p>(c) Extreme Violence, Gore, Mutilation, or Threats of Violence. Never post or share content including violence threats, acts of violence, murder, snuff, gore, mutilation, blood, or any other harmful act. Do not post extreme violent or horrific content to be edgy or to get attention. It will just get you banned.</p>

<p>(d) Bestiality or Harm Against Animals. Little fur friends don't deserve to be abused and content featuring such acts of abuse will result in a permanent account ban as well as a report to your local law enforcement agency for animal cruelty and abuse. </p>

<p>(e) Spam. xstumbl is a great place to promote your website, cam services, sexual escapades, or online paid membership services. However, don't go overboard and act like a spam bot by using excessive, irrelevant tags, by harrassing other members through spam offers, by injecting code into your page to mislead, disceive, or trick users with popups, blind links, or hidden scripts. Do not post paid ads within your page that result in excessive pop-ups or never ending click offers. </p>

<p>(f) Copyright or Trademark Infringement. Do not post content which you do not have the permission to post or share or content that is owned by someone else. We require a DMCA notice to be submitted when content is claimed to be owned by someone else and posted without their knowledge or consent. Repeat offenses of this will result in full account closure.</p>

<p>(g) Revenge Porn. Posting nudes or explicit content that you privately filmed or was given to you to never share with the public is forbidden. Revenge porn is an invasion of privacy and against the law. Do not post nudes of your ex, a celebrity, or a friend out of spite or revenge.</p>

<p>(h) Financial Scams or Prostitution. Never use xstumbl to scam others out of money through fraud, fake giveaways, deception or lies. You may also not use this service to promote illegal prostitution or escorting. We do allow users to promote any adult websites they are a member of, webcam services, or anything else they want to promote. You may never under any circumstance, promote illegal sexual activity. Never ask for users' credit card or financial information or send them off-site to complete a dating affiliate website offer.</p>

<p>(i) Impersonation. Do not try to impersonate people in the porn or cam industry or try to impersonate celebrities. It won't help you get laid, get more followers, or get attention. You'll just get banned and blocked and we'll forget about you.</p>

<p>Violations of any of the above instances will result in either a warning, removal of content, permanent ban, or lifetime account closure. </p>
